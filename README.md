# HealthScan

Internet of Things has revolutionized the way we monitor our personal health. With the introduction of wearable devices such as fitness trackers, smartwatches, and health monitors, individuals can now keep a closer eye on their health and wellness. IoT technology allows us to collect and analyze data in real-time to track our physical activity, heart rate, sleep patterns, and even blood pressure. This data not only helps individuals make better-informed decisions about their health but also enables healthcare providers to identify potential health issues before they become serious problems.<br>
This project aims to create an easy way on how to collect and access those informations.
